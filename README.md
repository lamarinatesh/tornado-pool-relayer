# Relayer for Tornado Cash Nova [![Build Status](https://github.com/tornadocash/tornado-pool-relayer/workflows/build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tornadocash/tornado-pool-relayer/actions) [![Docker Image Version (latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/tornadocash/nova-relayer?logo=docker&logoColor=%23FFFFFF&sort=semver)](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/tornadocash/nova-relayer)

## Getting listed on nova.tornado.cash

If you would like to be listed in nova.tornado.cash UI relayer's dropdown option, please do the following:

1. Set up tornado.cash relayer node(see below for docker-compose.yml example)
2. Set up ENS subdomain(`nova.xxx.eth`) with TEXT record and URL key that points to your DNS or IP address.
3. Test your relayer setup at https://nova.tornado.cash by choosing custom relayer's option on withdraw/transfer tab. Enter your ENS name or url and initiate an operation.
4. Open new Github issue in https://github.com/tornadocash/tornado-pool-relayer/issues and specify the following:

- your mainnet ens url
- your telegram handle
- withdrawal tx on mainnet and xdai
- transfer tx on xdai

Please choose your testnet relayer's fee wisely.

Disclaimer: Please consult with legal and tax advisors regarding the compliance of running a relayer service in your jurisdiction. The authors of this project bear no responsibility.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

## Deploy with docker-compose

docker-compose.yml contains a stack that will automatically provision SSL certificates for your domain name and will add an https redirect to port 80.

1. Download [docker-compose.yml](/docker-compose.yml) and [.env.example](/.env.example)

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tornadocash/tornado-pool-relayer/master/docker-compose.yml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tornadocash/tornado-pool-relayer/master/.env.example -O .env
```

2. Setup environment variables

   - set `CHAIN_ID` (100 for xdai, 1 for mainnet).
   - set `PRIVATE_KEY` for your relayer address (without 0x prefix).
   - set `VIRTUAL_HOST` and `LETSENCRYPT_HOST` to your domain and add DNS record pointing to your relayer ip address.
   - set `REWARD_ADDRESS` - eth address that is used to collect fees.
   - set `RPC_URL` rpc url for your node.
   - set `ORACLE_RPC_URL` - rpc url for mainnet node for fetching prices(always have to be on mainnet).
   - set `WITHDRAWAL_SERVICE_FEE` - fee in % that is used for tornado withdrawals.
   - set `TRANSFER_SERVICE_FEE` - fee is a fixed value in ether for transfer.
   - set `CONFIRMATIONS` if needed - how many block confirmations to wait before processing an event. Not recommended to set less than 3.
   - set `MAX_GAS_PRICE` if needed - maximum value of gwei value for relayer's transaction.

3. Run `docker-compose up -d`

## Run locally

1. `npm i`
2. `cp .env.example .env`
3. Modify `.env` as needed
4. `yarn start:dev`
5. Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
6. In order to execute withdraw/transfer request, you can run the following command

```bash
curl -X POST -H 'content-type:application/json' --data '<input data>' http://127.0.0.1:8000/transaction
```

Relayer should return a transaction hash.

In this case you will need to add https termination yourself because browsers with default settings will prevent https
tornado.cash UI from submitting your request over http connection.

## Architecture

- Abi: Json ABI for working with contracts
- Artifacts: The generated file contains typed contract instances
- Config:
  1. `bull.config.ts` bull service settings
  2. `configuration.ts` global application configuration
  3. `txManager.config.ts` txManager service settings
- Constants:
  1. `contracts.ts` addresses of contracts and rps
  2. `variables.ts` a range of variables to make things easier
- Modules:
  1. `controller.ts` Controller file that will contain all the application routes.
  2. `module.ts` The module file essentially bundles together all the controllers and providers of your application.
  3. `service.ts` The service will include methods that will perform a certain operation.
  4. `main.ts` The entry file of the application will take in your module bundle and create an app instance using the NestFactory provided by Nest.
- Services:
  1. `gas-price.ts` update gas prices
  2. `offchain-price.ts` update the exchange rate
  3. `provider.ts` add-on for working with ethers js
- Types: types for the application
- Utilities: helpful functions
